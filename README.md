# ML-Tasks
Perception, Non-Linear Regression, Digit Recognition, Language Classification

A repo for the machine learning tasks that needed to be completed for CS188 Project 5. For this project, I implemented

(1) a Perceptron model (implemented update rule for learning weights as well)

(2) a neural network that approximates sine over [-2π, 2π],

(3) a neural network that classifies 28x28 pixel images (stored as 784-dimensional vector) of handwritten digits from MNIST dataset, and

(4) a neural network that identifies the language a text is in (inspired by the Chrome feature, which also uses a Neural Net)
